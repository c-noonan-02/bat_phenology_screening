Insectivorous bats are strictly nocturnal animals that are vulnerable to disruption from artificial light. Given that many light-sensitive bats tend to avoid night light during roost departure, it is often assumed that nighttime light pollution reduces their foraging opportunities, albeit empirical evidence in support of this hypothesis remains elusive. Here, we used least horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus pusillus, to assess whether white artificial light is detrimental for the opportunities of foraging. We manipulated the levels of ambient illumination and perceived predation risk inside the bat roost. We monitored bats' emergence activity using high-speed video and audio recording systems. DNA based faecal dietary analysis and insect survey were applied to determine activity time of prey in foraging areas. Following experimentally manipulation of white light-emitting diode (LED) lighting 0-15 min after sunset, bat pass, flight duration, and echolocation pulse emission decreased. The mean emergence time of bats flying out was delayed by 14 min under lit treatment compared with the dark control. Only 10% of bats left for foraging during 40 min of light exposure. Aversive effects of LED light on bat emergence were robust regardless of the presence of a potential predator. Insect prey reached a peak of abundance between 30 and 60 min after sunset. These results demonstrate that white artificial light hinders evening emergence behavior in least horseshoe bats, leading to a mismatch between foraging onset and peak food availability. Our findings highlight that light pollution overrides foraging onset, suggesting the importance of improving artificial lighting scheme near the roosts of light-sensitive bats.","2021-11-01","2025-03-03 21:00:13","2025-03-03 21:00:13",NA,"",NA,"",288,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ELSEVIER SCI LTD Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"Bat; Emergence; Foraging opportunity; Light pollution; Photophobic behavior",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","Emergence time in horshoe bats, following experimental manipulation of lighting!","Insert Screener Name"

However, ALAN sensitivity can vary greatly even among closely related species and urgently needs study for much of the world's nocturnal wildlife, including bats. While an increasing number of bat species have recently been assessed for light tolerance, the spatial extent of ALAN's influence on bats has received little attention. This information need is a barrier to the protection of bats from ALAN in land-use planning and policy, and the development of best practices that effectively buffer bat habitat from light trespass. To help address this information gap for North America, we experimentally tested the distances up to which ALAN affects presence and activity of light-averse little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) and big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), and the composition of a foraging bat assemblage in Connecticut, USA. We used three residential-scale, white, LED floodlights to expose bat foraging habitat to ALAN and compared acoustic activity of bats at distances of 0, 25, 50, and 75 m from the lights between nights when the lights were on versus off. Little brown bats were present on significantly fewer light than dark nights at every distance. Lighting significantly reduced little brown bat activity overall and at the farthest location from the lights (75 m), where it was only 43% of dark-night activity despite < 1 lx of illuminance. Presence of big brown bats was not significantly affected at any distance. Big brown bat activity on light nights averaged 48-75% of dark-night activity at each distance but was significantly lower only at 0 m. As ex-pected, lighting had no effect on eastern red (Lasiurus borealis) or hoary bat (L. cinereus) presence or activity. Community composition on dark and light nights had an average dissimilarity of 38% and significantly differed at 0 m and 25 m. We conclude the type of ALAN we studied has a disturbance radius of at least 75 m for the little brown bat and up to 25 m for the big brown bat, with a resulting influence on community composition for up to 50 m. Cumulative habitat loss for the imperiled little brown bat caused by ALAN could therefore be substantial. We urge planners and natural resources regulators to consider these footprints when evaluating indirect impacts to bat habitat from current and future sources of ALAN across these species' ranges.","2023-12","2025-03-03 21:00:13","2025-03-03 21:00:13",NA,"",NA,"",48,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS Publisher: ELSEVIER Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"Artificial light at night; Bat community; Habitat loss; LED; Light pollution; Myotis lucifugus",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given"," Assessed presence and activity of bats, when lights were turned on and off.

Insects are attracted to street lights and few bat species take advantage of this by foraging on the attracted insects. ALAN potentially affects the temporal patterns of insect abundance and thereby bat foraging behaviour. In a natural dark environment, these patterns are usually bimodal, with an activity peak in the early evening and the morning. Little is known about how ALAN affects insect presence throughout the night, and whether the light spectrum plays a role. This is important, as these temporal changes may be a key driver of disturbances in bat-insect interactions. Here, we studied how white and red light affect insects' and bats' nightly activity patterns. The activity of insects and bats (Pipistrellus spp.) was recorded throughout the night at seven experimentally illuminated sites in a forest-edge ecosystem. ALAN disrupted activity patterns, with both insects and bats being more active throughout the night. ALAN facilitated all-night foraging in bats especially near white light, but these effects were attenuated near red light. The ability to forage throughout the night may be a key advantage causing synanthropic bats to dominate in illuminated environments, but this could also prove detrimental in the long term. As red light reduced disturbing effects of ALAN on insects and bats diel activity pattern, it opens the possibility of using spectral composition as a mitigation measure.","2024-08-25","2025-03-03 21:00:13","2025-03-03 21:00:13",NA,"",NA,"",940,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS Publisher: ELSEVIER Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"Bats; Foraging behaviour; Insects; Light colour; Light pollution; Prey-predator interaction",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","Recorded bat activity patterns with experimental illumination.

Here, we aimed to assess whether artificial light affects foraging behavior in Asian parti-colored bats (Vespertilio sinensis). We manipulated the spectra of light-emitting diode (LED) lighting in a laboratory. Using video and audio recording, we monitored foraging onset, total foraging time, food consumption, freezing behavior (temporary cessation of body movement), and echolocation vocalizations in triads of bats under each lighting condition. Analyses showed that the foraging activities of experimental bats were reduced under LED light. Green, yellow, and red light had greater negative effects on bats' foraging onset, total foraging time, and food consumption than white and blue light. LED light of different spectra induced increased freezing time and echolocation vocalizations in captive bats, except for the white light. The peak wavelength of light emission correlated positively with freezing time, estimated echolocation pulse rate (the number of echolocation pulses per minute), and foraging onset, but negatively with total foraging time and food consumption. These results demonstrate that artificial light disturbs foraging behavior in Asian parti-colored bats. Our findings have implications for understanding the influencing mechanism of light pollution on bat foraging. We used Asian parti-colored bats as a model to explore the impacts of artificial light on foraging behavior. We found that bats reduced their foraging activity under white, blue, green, yellow, and red light.

As even low light intensities might affect some taxa, concerns are arising about biological responses to widespread low light levels. We used data from a French citizen science bat monitoring program (1894 full-nights monitored on 1055 sites) to explore the landscape-scale effects of light on an open-space-foraging bat species, the Serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus). We assessed this species' abundance and timing of night-time activity (median time of activity) at foraging sites. ALAN, and to a lesser extent moonlight, reduced E. serotinus abundance. ALAN delayed activity, and this delay was amplified during overcast nights. On the contrary, where there was no ALAN, the higher the cloud cover, the earlier the activity occurred. Cloud cover likely darkened the night sky in rural locations, whereas it amplified skyglow in light-polluted places, increasing ALAN effects on bats. Interestingly, moonlight also delayed activity but this effect was weakened where there was ALAN. Our study shows that even fine variations of light levels could affect the spatiotemporal distribution of a common species usually considered to be “light tolerant”, with potential cascading effects on individual fitness and population dynamics. It stresses how urgent it is to preserve and restore dark areas to protect biodiversity from light pollution while working on light intensity and directivity where ALAN is needed.","2022-07-15","2025-03-03 21:00:13","2025-03-03 21:00:13",NA,"",NA,"",305,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND Publisher: ELSEVIER SCI LTD Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"Artificial light at night; Bat; Citizen science; Moonlight; Skyglow; Timing of activity",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","Assessed timing of night-time activity in bats at differentially lit sites.

However, it is an environmental pollutant to many wildlife species. We found that in the city artificial light at night attracted insects, which could be a source of food for bats. However, whether bats could use this food source depended on their ability to navigate through objects in space. We found that bats that preferred open habitats did not fully use insects attracted by artificial light at night when foraging sites were cluttered by fences, billboards, and other objects. In contrast, bats that were considered not to benefit from artificial light at night could take advantage of cluttered sites and be more active and forage more. Lastly, there were a few species absent in our study, which could be light-sensitive and not adaptive to urban environments. We suggest that limiting or reducing artificial light at night is needed to conserve bats. Predators respond to the increase of prey by aggregation in space or foraging more often. However, foraging habitat suitability limits predators' responses. For nocturnal insectivorous bats, artificial light at night (ALAN) can trigger insect prey aggregation. It is not clear how ALAN might affect predator-prey relationships in the urban setting, where urban bats could have adapted to the city, and novel spatial complexity introduced by man-made objects might alter foraging habitat suitability. We strategically selected sites to represent different levels of ALAN and spatial complexity. We recorded bat commuting and foraging activities and collected aerial insects to examine how ALAN and spatial complexity affected bat-insect relationships. We found that insect biomass was positively correlated with ALAN, but was not affected by spatial complexity. Large-sized big brown bats and hoary bats positively responded to change of prey in open sites whereas small-sized eastern red bats and silver-haired bats positively responded in cluttered sites, suggesting that the impact of ALAN could vary when ALAN is coupled with urban spatial complexity. Our study demonstrates that foraging habitat suitability can alter which species might benefit from ALAN. Predator-prey relationships in cities are complex, but general ecological principles still apply in novel urban ecosystems.","2022-06","2025-03-03 21:00:13","2025-03-03 21:00:13",NA,"",NA,"6",11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"ALAN; artificial light at night; bats; foraging activity; insects; predator-prey relationships; spatial complexity; trophic dynamics; urban",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No Decision","No reason given","Focus on affect of spatial complexity of cities - so not the same data, but unclear if I could extract the numbers I need anyway.

The response of bats to ALAN ranges from some opportunistic species taking advantage of insect aggregations around street lamps, particularly those emitting ultraviolet (UV) light, to others avoiding lit areas at all. Tree cover has been suggested to mitigate the negative effects of ALAN on bats by shielding areas against light scatter. Here, we investigated the effect of tree cover on the relationship between ALAN and bats in Berlin, Germany. In particular, we asked if this interaction varies with the UV light spectrum of street lamps and also across urban bat species. We expected trees next to street lamps to block ALAN, making the adjacent habitat more suitable for all species, irrespective of the wavelength spectrum of the light source. Additionally, we expected UV emitting lights next to trees to attract insects and thus, opportunistic bats. In summer 2017, we recorded bat activity at 22 green open spaces in Berlin using automated ultrasonic detectors. We analyzed bat activity patterns and landscape variables (number of street lamps with and without UV light emission, an estimate of light pollution, and tree cover density around each recording site within different spatial scales) using generalized linear mixed-effects models with a negative binomial distribution. We found a species-specific response of bats to street lamps with and without UV light, providing a more detailed picture of ALAN impacts than simply total light radiance. Moreover, we found that dense tree cover dampened the negative effect of street lamps without UV for open-space foraging bats of the genera Nyctalus, Eptesicus, and Vespertilio, yet it amplified the already existing negative or positive effect of street lamps with or without UV on Pipistrellus pipistrellus, P. pygmaeus, and Myotis spp. Our study underpins the importance of minimizing artificial light at night close to vegetation, particularly for bats adapted to spatial complexity in the environment (i.e., clutter-adapted species), and to increase dense vegetation in urban landscape to provide, besides roosting opportunities, protection against ALAN for open-space foraging bats in city landscapes.","2019-03-27","2025-03-03 21:00:13","2025-03-03 21:00:13",NA,"",NA,"",7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"ALAN; bats; canopy cover; chiroptera; light-emitting diodes; trees; ultraviolet light; urban",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No Decision","No reason given","Measured bat activity against light, but different measures of light and may have to add tree cover as a moderator.

Using an experimental approach, we provide the first evidence of negative impacts of part-night lighting (PNL) strategies on bats. Feeding activity of Myotis spp. was reduced along rivers exposed to PNL despite no reduction in overall bat activity. We also provide the first evidence of negative effects of PNL on both feeding and activity for Pipistrellus pipistrellus which has previously been recorded feeding under artificial light. Despite having considerable energy-saving benefits, we outline the potential negative impacts of PNL schemes for bats in riparian habitats. PNL are unlikely to provide desired conservation outcomes for bats, and can potentially fragment important foraging habitats leading to a breakdown of functional connectivity across the landscape.

Among the light types used for street lamps, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are expected to become globally predominant within the next few years. In a large-scale field experiment, we recorded bat activity at 46 street lights for 12 nights each and investigated how the widespread replacement of conventional illuminants by LEDs affects urban bats: we compared bat activity at municipal mercury vapour (MV) street lamps that were replaced by LEDs with control sites that were not changed.Pipistrellus pipistrellus was the most frequently recorded species; it was 45% less active at LEDs than at MV street lamps, but the activity did not depend on illuminance level. Light type did not affect the activity of Pipistrellus nathusii, Pipistrellus pygmaeus or bats in the Nyctalus/Eptesicus/Vespertilio (NEV) group, yet the activity of P.nathusii increased with illuminance level. Bats of the genus Myotis increased activity 45-fold at LEDs compared with MV lights, but illuminance level had no effect. Decreased activity of P.pipistrellus, which are considered light tolerant, probably paralleled insect densities around lights. Further, our results suggest that LEDs may be less repelling for light-averse Myotis spp. than MV lights. Accordingly, the transition from conventional lighting techniques to LEDs may greatly alter the anthropogenic impact of artificial light on urban bats and might eventually affect the resilience of urban bat populations.Synthesis and applications. At light-emitting diodes (LEDs), the competitive advantage - the exclusive ability to forage on insect aggregations at lights - is reduced for light-tolerant bats. Thus, the global spread of LED street lamps might lead to a more natural level of competition between light-tolerant and light-averse bats. This effect could be reinforced if the potential advantages of LEDs over conventional illuminants are applied in practice: choice of spectra with relatively little energy in the short wavelength range; reduced spillover by precisely directing light; dimming during low human activity times; and control by motion sensors. Yet, the potential benefits of LEDs could be negated if low costs foster an overall increase in artificial lighting.","2017-02","2025-03-03 21:00:13","2025-03-03 21:00:13",NA,"264-271",NA,"1",54,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"artificial light at night; bats; Chiroptera; light pollution; light-emitting diode; phototaxis; pipistrellus; synanthropic; urban",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No Decision","No reason given","Compared bat activity at street lamps - control vs replaced with LEDs.

We predicted that (1) the number of bat species and drinking events will be lower under illumination and (2) forest bat species will be more affected than edge specialists. We recorded 2549 drinking events from 12 species or species groups, most of which decreased drinking activity under illumination. The effects of ALAN on drinking were stronger than on foraging. Forest species never drank when the light was on. Edge-foraging species reduced drinking activity while also increasing foraging under lit conditions. We highlight a previously overlooked negative effect of ALAN on bats, whose implications may be locally catastrophic. Given the importance of water sites for both bat foraging and drinking, their illumination should be forbidden, appropriately mitigated or, if necessary, compensated for with the creation of alternative drinking sites.","2017-12","2025-03-03 21:00:13","2025-03-03 21:00:13",NA,"492-501",NA,"6",20,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"aquatic habitat; Chiroptera; dehydration; foraging; light pollution; light-emitting diode; ultrasound",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No Decision","No reason given","Assessed drinking activity at experimentally illuminated cattle troughs.

Since the recent evolution in light technologies in improving luminous efficacy, developed countries are experiencing a renewal of their lighting equipment that reaches its end-of-life, from conventional lighting technologies to light emitting diodes (LEDs). Despite potential cascading impacts of such a shift on nocturnal fauna, few studies have so far dealt with the impact of the renewal of street lighting by new technologies. Specifically, only one study, by Rowse et al.2016, examined the effects of switching from widely used low pressure sodium (LPS) lamps to LEDs, using bats as biological models. This study was based on a before-after-control-impact paired design (BACIP) at 12 pairs in the UK, each including one control and one experimental streetlight. If Rowse et al. 2016 showed no effect of switching to LEDs streetlights on bat activity, the effects of respective changes in light intensity and spectrum were not disentangled when testing switch effects. Here, we conduct a retrospective analysis of their data to include these covariates in statistical models with the aim of disentangling the relative effects of these light characteristics. Our re-analysis clearly indicates that the switches in spectrum and in intensity with replacement of LPS with LED lamps have significant additive and interactive effects, on bat activity. We also show that bat activity and buzz ratio decrease with increasing LED intensity while an opposite effect is observed with LPS lamps. Hence, the loss or the gain in bat activity when lamp types, i.e., spectrum, are switched strongly depends on the initial and new lamp intensities. Our results stress the need to consider simultaneously the effects of changes in the different lights characteristics when street lighting changes. Because switches from LPS to LED lamps can lead to an increase in light intensity, such technological changes may involve a reduction of bat activity in numerous cases, especially at high LED intensities. Since we are currently at an important crossroad in lighting management, we recommend to limit LED intensity and improve its spectral composition toward warmer colors to limit potential deleterious impacts on bat activity.","2020-04","2025-03-03 21:00:13","2025-03-03 21:00:13",NA,"",NA,"4",12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"artificial light at night; bat activity; Chiroptera; LED streetlight; light pollution",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No Decision","No reason given","Assessed impact of LEDs (versus standard LPS) lamps on bat activity - but not sure it is based on time of activity!","Insert Screener Name"

However, at night such resources may lose attractiveness when they are in artificially lit areas. For bats, attraction to such manmade habitats might be species specific. In an isolated village in the Negev desert that is known for its high bat activity we investigated the effects of artificial lighting on flight behaviour of two aerial insectivorous bat species: Pipistrellus kuhlii, a non-desert synanthropic bat, common in urban environments and Eptesicus bottae, a desert-dwelling species. Using an acoustic tracking system we reconstructed flight trajectories for bats that flew under artificial lights [Light treatment (L)] versus in natural darkness [Dark treatment (D)]. Under L both P. kuhlii and E. bottae flew significantly faster than under D. Under L, P. kuhlii also flew at significantly lower altitude (i.e. away from a floodlight) than under D. Whereas P. kuhlii foraged both in L and D, E. bottae only foraged in D. In L, activity of E. bottae decreased and it merely transited the illuminated area at commuting rather than foraging speed. Thus, under artificially lighted conditions the non-desert synanthropic species may have a competitive advantage over the native desert species and may outcompete it for aerial insect prey. Controlling light pollution in deserts and keeping important foraging sites unlit may reduce the synanthropic species' competitive advantage over native desert bats.","2011-09","2025-03-03 21:00:13","2025-03-03 21:00:13",NA,"21-27",NA,"1",285,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY-BLACKWELL Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"desert bats; Eptesicus bottae; flight behaviour; light pollution; Pipistrellus kuhlii",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No Decision","No reason given","Recorded bat activity under different light treatments.

Thus, artificial lights may change the environment in such a way as to create winners and losers as some species benefit while others do not. Insectivorous bats are nocturnal and a good model to test for differential effects of light pollution on a single community. We used a physiological technique to address this community-level question by measuring plasma ss-hydroxybutyrate (a blood metabolite) concentrations from six species of insectivorous bats in lit and unlit conditions. We also recorded bat calls acoustically to measure activity levels between experimental conditions. Blood metabolite level and acoustic activity data suggest species-specific changes in foraging around lights. In red bats (Lasiurus borealis), ss-hydroxybutyrate levels at lit sites were highest early in the night before decreasing. Acoustic data indicate pronounced peaks in activity at lit sites early in the night. In red bats on dark nights and in the other species in this community, which seem to avoid lights, ss-hydroxybutyrate remained relatively constant. Our results suggest red bats are more willing to expend energy to actively forage around lights despite potential negative impacts, while other, generally rarer species avoid lit areas. Artificial light appears to have a bifurcating effect on bat communities, whereby some species take advantage of concentrated prey resources, yet most do not. Further, this may concentrate light-intolerant species into limited dark refugia, thereby increasing competition for depauperate, phototactic insect communities.","2019-01","2025-03-03 21:00:13","2025-03-03 21:00:13",NA,"69-77",NA,"1",189,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"-Hydroxybutyrate; Bat-insect interactions; LED; Light pollution; Plasma metabolite analysis",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","Measured bat activity - had peak levels of activity so should have timings of activity!","Insert Screener Name"

To date, ecological impacts of individual LED properties (color temperature, dimmability) have been studied, while interactions between light properties or aspects of luminaire design have not been addressed. However, the design of luminaires can influence ALAN impacts as the shape determines the spatial distribution of light and its visibility in the environment. This may cause amplifying or mitigating effects. We assessed the relative individual and interacting effects of two LED luminaire designs and three LED color temperatures (1750 K, 3000 K, 4000 K) on nocturnal insect abundance, bat foraging and feeding activity. We considered a standard LED luminaire shape with focused light emission and a luminaire shape with a diffusor to scatter the light spatially, leading to increased visibility of the light in the environment. During 104 nights, we trapped 51263 nocturnal insects of which 97% were caught at lights and 3% at dark sites. For bats, up to 44.8% fewer acoustic signals were recorded at dark sites. We caught 31% insects at LEDs with1750 K, 34% and 35% at 3000 K and 4000 K, respectively. Thus, color temperatures of 1750 K proved less detrimental than 3000/4000 K. Effects of luminaire shape led to an increase (16%) of trapped insects for luminaires with diffusors compared to the standard shape. In addition, luminaires with diffusors amplified the effects of LED color (+12% insects at 1750 K/3000 K; +25.6% at 4000 K). In contrast, bat foraging activity was independent of the light treatments while bat feeding activity was increased by 21.5% at standard luminaire shapes. Likely, intense straylight at diffused lights negatively affects the target-focused echolocation by deterring the bats. We concluded that ecological impacts of luminaire shape are an important, yet underestimated variable in light-pollution impact research.

Most of what is known is based on decades-old observations of bats around street lights with traditional lighting technologies that have been increasingly replaced by energy-efficient broad-spectrum lighting, rendering our understanding of the contemporary effects of ALAN on North American bats even less complete. We experimentally tested the effects of broad-spectrum ALAN on presence/absence, foraging activity, and species composition in a Connecticut, USA bat community by illuminating foraging habitat with light-emitting diode (LED) floodlights and comparing acoustic recordings between light and dark conditions. Lighting dramatically decreased presence and activity of little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), which we detected on only 14% of light nights compared with 65% of dark (lights off) and 69% of control (lights removed) nights. Big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) activity on light nights averaged only half that of dark and control nights. Lighting did not affect presence/absence of silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans), but decreased their activity. There were no effects on eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis) or hoary bats (L. cinereus), which have been described previously as light-tolerant. Aversion to lighting by some species but not others caused a significant shift in community composition, thereby potentially altering competitive balances from natural conditions. Our results demonstrate that only a small degree of ALAN can represent a significant form of habitat degradation for some North American bats, including the endangered little brown bat. Research on the extent to which different lighting technologies, colors, and intensities affect these species is urgently needed and should be a priority in conservation planning for North America's bats.","2021-05","2025-03-03 21:00:14","2025-03-03 21:00:14",NA,"5635-5645",NA,"10",11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"artificial light at night; community composition; emitting diode; light&#8208; Myotis lucifugus",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No Decision","No reason given","Measured foraging activity on light and dark nights.

Methods We equipped 20 bats with miniaturized GPS loggers in the Berlin metropolitan area and related spatial positions of bats to anthropogenic and natural landscape features and levels of ALAN. Results Common noctules foraged close to ALAN only next to bodies of water or well vegetated areas, probably to exploit swarms of insects lured by street lights. In contrast, they avoided illuminated roads, irrespective of vegetation cover nearby. Predictive maps identified most of the metropolitan area as non-favoured by this species because of high levels of impervious surfaces and ALAN. Dark corridors were used by common noctules for commuting and thus likely improved the permeability of the city landscape. Conclusions We conclude that the spatial use of common noctules, previously considered to be more tolerant to light than other bats, is largely constrained by ALAN.

Strictly nocturnal animals such as bats are particularly sensitive to artificial light at night (ALAN). Past studies have shown that bats, in general, respond to ALAN according to the emitted light color and that migratory bats, in particular, exhibit phototaxis in response to green light. As red and white light is frequently used in outdoor lighting, we asked how migratory bats respond to these wavelength spectra. At a major migration corridor, we recorded the presence of migrating bats based on ultrasonic recorders during 10-min light-on/light-off intervals to red or warm-white LED, interspersed with dark controls. When the red LED was switched on, we observed an increase in flight activity for Pipistrellus pygmaeus and a trend for a higher activity for Pipistrellus nathusii. As the higher flight activity of bats was not associated with increased feeding, we rule out the possibility that bats foraged at the red LED light. Instead, bats may have flown toward the red LED light source. When exposed to warm-white LED, general flight activity at the light source did not increase, yet we observed an increased foraging activity directly at the light source compared to the dark control. Our findings highlight a response of migratory bats toward LED light that was dependent on light color. The most parsimonious explanation for the response to red LED is phototaxis and for the response to warm-white LED foraging. Our findings call for caution in the application of red aviation lighting, particularly at wind turbines, as this light color might attract bats, leading eventually to an increased collision risk of migratory bats at wind turbines.","2018-09","2025-03-03 21:00:14","2025-03-03 21:00:14",NA,"9353-9361",NA,"18",8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"animal orientation; aviation lighting; bat migration; conservation; light pollution; phototaxis; wind turbines",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No Decision","No reason given","Measured flight activity (maybe not timing?) with different coloured lights.","Insert Screener Name"

Actions targeting habitat improvements to aid population resilience and recovery may be beneficial long-term strategies, yet testing the efficacy of such strategies before major conservation investments are made can be challenging. 2. The disease white-nose syndrome (WNS) has caused severe declines in several species of North American hibernating bats. We tested a novel conservation approach targeted at improving foraging conditions near bat hibernacula by experimentally manipulating insect density in the pre-hibernation fattening period and spring emergence recovery period. We measured foraging (feeding buzzes) and echolocation activity of little brown bats Myotis lucifugus at ultraviolet (UV) light lures to determine behavioural response to augmented foraging conditions and characterized insect availability at UV light lures. 3. In the fall, bat foraging activity was three times greater (95% CI: 1.5-5.8; p = 0.002) when UV lights were on, but there was no statistical support for differences in echolocation activity response when our experimental design alternated between nights with lights on and off. In the spring, we allowed UV light lures to run consistently each night and compared with a control location in similar habitat. Bat foraging activity was 8.5 times greater (95% CI: 4.5-16.0; p < 0.0001) and echolocation activity was 4.4 times higher (95% CI: 3.0-6.5; p < 0.0001) at UV light lures in the spring experiment. In both the fall and spring, UV light lures resulted in concentrated insect availability, attracting primarily moths (Order: Lepidoptera). In both seasons, nightly temperature had a strong influence on bat foraging, echolocation and insect activity. 4. We show that a bat species threatened by WNS used enhanced foraging habitats near hibernacula during the critical pre- and post-hibernation phases of their annual cycle. While light lures are unlikely to be a long-term management strategy, our experiment provides initial evidence that bats behaviourally respond with increased foraging activity in areas with augmented insect prey availability. Our experimental results support developing management strategies focused on habitat protection, including restoration and enhancement of foraging habitats, in the immediate vicinity of bat hibernacula.","2023-01","2025-03-03 21:00:14","2025-03-03 21:00:14",NA,"",NA,"1",4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"bats; conservation evidence; foraging behaviour; habitat protection; habitat restoration; insect prey; white-nose syndrome; wildlife disease management",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No Decision","No reason given","Measured foraging and echolocation activity levels, using white light lures.

Many fast-flying insectivorous bat species feed on insects that are attracted to light-emitting ultraviolet radiation (10-400 nm). Several countries are currently focused on replacing mercury vapour lamps, which emit ultraviolet light, with more cost-efficient light-emitting diode (LED) lights, which emit less ultraviolet radiation. This reduction in ultraviolet light may cause declines in insect densities in cities, predatory fast-flying bats, and some edge-foraging and slow-flying bats. Capitalising on a scheme to update streetlights from high ultraviolet mercury vapour to low ultraviolet LED in Sydney, Australia, we measured the activity of individual bat species, the activity of different functional groups and the bat and insect communities, before and after the change in technology. We also surveyed sites with already LED lights, sites with mercury vapour lights and unlit bushland remnants. Species adapted to foraging in cluttered vegetation, and some edge-space foraging species, were more active in unlit bushland sites than in all lit sites and decreased in activity at lit sites after the change to LED lights. The change to LED streetlights caused a decrease in the fast-flying Chalinolobus gouldii but not Miniopterus schreibersii oceanensis, the latter being more influenced by seasonal and environmental variables. Insect biomass was not affected by changing light types, but instead was negatively correlated with the moon's percentage illuminance. Changing streetlights to LEDs could result in a decline in some insectivorous bats in cities. This study confirms that unlit urban bushland remnants are important refuges for high bat diversity, particularly for more clutter-adapted species and some edge-space foraging species. Preventing light penetration into unlit bushland patches and corridors remains essential to protect the urban bat community.","2019-09","2025-03-03 21:00:14","2025-03-03 21:00:14",NA,"1052-1064",NA,"6",44,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"artificial light; artificial light at night; light-emitting diode; mercury vapour; species traits; urban ecosystems",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No Decision","No reason given","Measured activity levels with mercury vapour lamps and LED lamps.

In otherwise dark environments, street lights restrict the use of major flight routes by some bats, including the threatened lesser horseshoe bat Rhinolophus hipposideros, and may disrupt foraging. Using radio tracking, we examined the response of individual female R. hipposideros to experimental street lights placed on hedgerows used as major flight routes. Hedgerows were illuminated on one side over four nights using lights with different emission spectra, while the opposite side of the hedge was not illuminated. Automated bat detectors were used to examine changes in overall bat activity by R. hipposideros and other bat species present. R. hipposideros activity reduced significantly under all light types, including red light, challenging a previously held assumption that red light is safe for bats. Despite this, R. hipposideros rapidly adapted to the presence of lights by switching their flight paths to the dark side of the hedgerow, enabling them to reach foraging sites without restriction. Red light had no effect on the activity of the other species present. Slow-flying Myotis spp. avoided orange, white and green light, while more agile Pipistrellus spp. were significantly more active at these light types compared to dark controls, most probably in response to accumulations of insect prey. No effect of any light type was found for Nyctalus or Eptesicus spp. Our findings demonstrate that caution must be used when promoting forms of lighting that are thought to be safe for wildlife before they are tested more widely. We argue that it is essential to preserve dark corridors to mitigate the impacts of artificial light at night on bat activity and movements.","2018-12","2025-03-03 21:00:14","2025-03-03 21:00:14",NA,"5909-5918",NA,"12",24,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"artificial light at night; bats; behaviour; dark corridors; Rhinolophus hipposideros; street lights",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No Decision","No reason given","Recorded bat activity on illulminated and un-illuminated sides of hedgerow.

Human footprint can reduce animal movement through barrier effects such as habitat change and fragmentation, or through enhanced resources. Artificial light at night (ALAN) can affect the movement of nocturnal animals such as bats that are highly mobile in the landscape. Very few studies have explicitly quantified the choices that moving bats make when they encounter a light source on their flight routes. We assessed whether ALAN of different colours (green, red and white) compared to control conditions affected the use of ecological corridors, considering (i) activity and (ii) movement along the corridor, for open, edge (i.e. light-opportunistic) and narrow-space (i.e. light-averse) foraging bats. We modelled the effects of 28 independent lampposts at four experimental sites on bat activity and movement (i.e. the number of trajectories towards the lamppost and the probability of lamppost crossing). Each lamppost was sampled two to three times over eight complete nights using paired passive acoustic stereo recorders to record bat activity and reconstruct bat trajectories. Narrow-space foragers were much less active in presence of any light source, and fewer flew towards any lit lampposts. Open and edge-space foragers were more active close to white and green lights, and to a lesser extent red light, compared to unlit control sites. Edge-space foragers overall flew more towards white and green lampposts, but had a lower probability of fully crossing a white and red-lighted site. The study shows that ALAN can strongly alter bat movements along landscape structures, for light-averse but also light-opportunistic species. Such changes in flight behaviour may involve bypasses or detours, which may force bats to fly longer distances at night which could ultimately affect fitness. Our findings suggest that avoiding artificial lighting close to flight routes will benefit bats.","2023-12","2025-03-03 21:00:14","2025-03-03 21:00:14",NA,"865-875",NA,"6",26,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"artificial light; barrier effect; bat movement; Chiroptera; ecological corridors; flight behaviour; functional connectivity; streetlight crossing",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No Decision","No reason given","Measured activity levels along ecological corridors with different colours of light and controls.

ALAN also affects bat drinking activity, at least when lighting occurs over short intervals. We tested whether continuous illumination of drinking sites over 4-h periods would lead bats to tolerate ALAN and resume drinking in the course of the night. We conducted our experiments in forest (Italy) and desert (Israel) sites to test whether in the latter habitat, where water is scarce, a greater motivation to drink might lead to less adverse bat reactions. We recorded 6853 drinking buzzes and 1647 feeding buzzes from 17 species and one species group. In the forest sites, species that hunt in open spaces or along forest edges showed little (P. pipistrellus and H. savii) or no (P. kuhlii and N. leisleri) drinking activity decrease, while those associated with forest interiors (Barbastella barbastellus, Plecotus auritus and bats in the genus Myotis) exhibited a strong negative response. In the desert sites, all studied species reduced drinking activity, yet in the desert populations of P. kuhlii we recorded stronger adverse reactions only far from human settlements. The harsh reactions that the desert bat species showed towards ALAN rule out any effect of a greater motivation to drink. Illumination had no effect on foraging by most species, except in the forest sites, where Pipistrellus kuhlii and Nyctalus leisleri increased foraging when the light was on, and in the desert sites, where Hypsugo bodenheimeri decreased foraging in such situations. The progressive human encroachment that is taking place in many world regions on both forests and especially deserts, where few sites for drinking are available, may jeopardize bat populations also through increased exposure to ALAN.","2019-04","2025-03-03 21:00:14","2025-03-03 21:00:14",NA,"124-133",NA,"2",22,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"Chiroptera; foraging; habituation; Israel; Italy; light pollution; urbanization; water",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","Measured drinking activity.","Insert Screener Name"

This paper reviews the impacts of lighting on bats and their prey, exploring the direct and indirect consequences of lighting intensity and spectral composition. In addition, new data from large-scale surveys involving more than 265 000 bat calls at more than 600 locations in two countries are presented, showing that prevalent street-lighting types are not generally linked with increased activity of common and widespread bat species. Such bats, which are important to ecosystem function, are generally considered `light-attracted' and likely to benefit from the insect congregations that form at lights. Leisler's bat (Nyctalus leisleri) may be an exception, being more frequent in lit than dark transects. For common pipistrelle bats (Pipistrellus pipistrellus), lighting is negatively associated with their distribution on a landscape scale, but there may be local increases in habitats with good tree cover.

Nevertheless, certain areas within highly urbanised cities may be suitable to harbour bat populations. Thus, managing urban habitats could contribute to bat conservation. Here, we wanted to establish evidence-based recommendations on how to improve urban spaces for the protection of bats. In a team effort with >200 citizen scientists, we recorded bat vocalisations up to six times over the course of 2 years at each of 600 predefined sites in the Berlin metropolitan area. For each species we identified the preferred and non-preferred landscape features. Our results show that artificial light at night (ALAN) had a negative impact on all species. For soprano pipistrelles and mouse-eared bats ALAN had the largest effect sizes among all environmental predictors. Canopy cover and open water were especially important for bat species that forage along vegetation edges and for trawling bats, respectively. Occurrence probability of species foraging in open space decreased with increasing distance to water bodies. On a larger scale, impervious surfaces tended to have positive effects on some species that are specialised on foraging along edge structures. Our study constitutes an important contribution to the growing body of literature showing that despite the many negative impacts of urbanisation on wildlife, urban environments can harbour bat populations if certain conditions are met, such as access to vegetation and water bodies and low levels of ALAN. Our findings are of high relevance for urban planners and conservationists, as they allow inferences on how to manage urban spaces in a bat-friendly way. We recommend limiting ALAN to the minimum necessary and maintaining and creating uninterrupted vegetated corridors between areas with high levels of canopy cover and water bodies, in which ALAN should be entirely avoided.","2022-03-15","2025-03-03 21:00:14","2025-03-03 21:00:14",NA,"",NA,"",297,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ELSEVIER SCI LTD Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"ALAN; Bats; Light pollution; Urban ecosystem; Urban greening; Urbanisation",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","Not considering activity etc., focus on occurrence.

However, despite the recent awareness on the adverse effects of light on bats, little is known regarding the potential impacts of light trapping on the bat sampling outcomes when passive acoustic sampling and light trapping are implemented simultaneously. Using a before-after experimental design that involved the installation of a 6W actinic light trap 1m away from the bat detector, we tested the predictions that (1) slow-flying bat species will be less active when the light trap is present, while the opposite will be true for fast-flying species; and (2) bat species richness will be lower at lit conditions compared to dark ones. Our results suggest that the use of light traps in combination with bat detectors may considerably influence the outcomes of acoustic sampling. Although the activity of fast-flying bat species did not differ between the two treatments, we found that the activity of slow-flying ones such as Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and Rhinolophus hipposideros decreased significantly at lit conditions. Furthermore, we recorded fewer bat species when the light trap was deployed. To overcome this issue, we strongly recommend either (1) placing light traps at a considerable distance from bat detectors; or (2) using light traps during the night that follows the bat sampling if sampling needs to be at the same position; or (3) deploying non-attractant insect traps such as Malaise traps if Lepidoptera is not the main order targeted.","2018-09","2025-03-03 21:00:14","2025-03-03 21:00:14",NA,"240-247",NA,"3",4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"Activity; artificial light; bat detector; moth trap; sampling method; species richness",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No Decision","No reason given","Tested activity of slow and fast flying species where light traps are and are not deployed.

We acoustically surveyed 31 forest edges across greater Sydney, Australia, half with mercury vapour streetlights and half in ambient darkness, and compared the bat assemblage and activity levels to urban forest interiors. We also sampled the flying insect community to establish whether changes in insect densities under lights drive changes in insectivorous bat activity. We recorded 9965 bat passes from 16 species or species groups throughout our acoustic survey. The activity of all bats, and bats hypothesised to be sensitive to artificial light, was consistently higher in forest interiors as opposed to edges. We found that slower flying bats adapted to cluttered vegetation or with a relatively high characteristic echolocation call frequency; Chalinolobus mono, Miniopterus australis, Vespadelus vulturnus, and Nyctophilus spp., were negatively affected by artificial light sources at the forest edge.

However, the required needs of humans and wildlife may conflict, resulting in a structure that does not actually provide the perceived improvement in cost-effectiveness, but instead a reduction in conservation benefits. For example, lighting within crossing structures for human safety at night may reduce use of the structure by nocturnal wildlife, thus contributing to barrier and mortality effects of roads rather than mitigating them. In this study, we experimentally evaluated the impact of artificial light at night on the rate of use of wildlife crossing structures, specifically underpasses, by ten insectivorous bat species groups in south-eastern Australia. We monitored bat activity before, during and after artificially lighting the underpasses. We found that bats tended to avoided lit underpasses, and only one species consistently showed attraction to the light. Artificial light at night in underpasses hypothetically increases the vulnerability of bats to road-mortality or to the barrier effect of roads. The most likely outcomes of lighting underpasses were 1. an increase in crossing rate above the freeway and a decrease under the underpasses, or 2. a reduction in crossing rate both above freeways and under the underpasses, when structures were lit. Our results corroborate those of studies on terrestrial mammals, and thus we recommend that underpasses intended to facilitate the movement of wildlife across roads should not be lit.","2020-05-15","2025-03-03 21:00:14","2025-03-03 21:00:14",NA,"",NA,"",262,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND Publisher: ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"Chiroptera; Connectivity; Human-wildlife; Impact of light; Road ecology; Underpasses",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No Decision","No reason given","Monitored bat activity before during and after artificial lighting.

It interferes with the fundamental 24 h light-dark cycle, and has biological effects at all levels, from molecules to ecosystems, including human health and welfare. Here, exemplified by flood-lit churches, artificial lights compromise the survival of resident bats, as darkness provides protection from predation. We predicted that brown long-eared bats Plecotus auritus emerging from churches should (1) avoid illuminated church walls, and (2) avoid extended flights in the open. To test these predictions, bats were observed emerging from 33 country churches in Sweden. A model for light intensity at increasing distances from light sources was made. This model, in combination with known distance between church walls and surrounding lamps, was used to predict lux levels (lx) at each church wall. Higher light intensities were strictly avoided and the majority of bats emerged when light intensities at church walls were below 1.25 lx. Further, most brown long-eared bats flew into the canopy of trees less than 15 m distant from the churches. Bats and their roosts are strictly protected in Europe, but this is poorly enforced with respect to churches and other historical buildings. Nevertheless, lighting of buildings is a key issue in bat conservation and of worldwide significance. We strongly advise that installation of lights near historical buildings is regulated and subject to environmental impact assessments.","2021-12","2025-03-03 21:00:14","2025-03-03 21:00:14",NA,"979-986",NA,"6",101,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY Publisher: SPRINGER HEIDELBERG Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"Flood-lights; Light pollution; Risk avoidance; Roost quality",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No Decision","No reason given","Evaluated effect of lighting on emergence - but whether or not they emerged, probably not timing?","Insert Screener Name"

Although research is now addressing the negative impacts of anthropogenic noise on biota, less attention has been paid to the effects of light pollution. Changes in lighting technology have led to a diverse range of emerging low energy light types and a trend towards the increased use of white light. Light pollution affects ecological interactions across a range of taxa and has adverse effects on behaviours such as foraging, reproduction and communication. Almost a quarter of bat species globally are threatened and the key underlying threat to populations is pressure on resources from increasing human populations. Being nocturnal, bats are among the taxa most likely to be affected by light pollution. In this paper we provide an overview of the current trends in artificial lighting followed by a review of the current evidence of the impacts of lighting on bat behaviour, particularly foraging, commuting, emergence, roosting and hibernation. We discuss taxon-specific effects and potential cumulative ecosystem level impacts. We conclude by summarising some potential strategies to minimise the impacts of lighting on bats and identify key gaps in knowledge and priority areas for future research.

The main purpose was to test whether aerial-hawking insectivorous bats that feed in open places (in this case mostly Scotophilus and Scotoecus spp.) show lunar phobia, i.e. restricting their activity on moonlit nights. Such behavior would be an expected response to the threat posed by visually oriented aerial predators such as bat hawks, owls and carnivorous bats. The occurrence of lunar phobia in bats is a controversial issue and may have implications for how bats will be affected by increasing light pollution. Our results show that foraging activity of the bats that we studied was related to time of day, season, and habitat, albeit with no additional effect of moonlight discernable. We therefore conclude that foraging activity occurs independently of moonlight. This result is partly at odds with previous findings including predictions from a meta-analysis of lunar phobia in bats, which indicates that lunar phobia is common in these animals, though most likely to be present in tropical species that feed in open situations near vegetation and over water. Equally, our results conform to findings from studies of aerial insectivorous bats in tropical as well as temperate areas, most of which have failed to reveal any clear evidence of lunar phobia. We believe that moonlight generally does not facilitate aerial predation on flying bats in open situations, or, alternatively, the bats accept increased predation pressure while they fulfil the energetic requirements through hunting.

We measured aerial insectivore responses to light pollution in a tropical cloud forest to test this hypothesis. Bat echolocation was recorded at 20 pairs of light and dark sites in Monteverde, Costa Rica. Foraging activity was higher at artificially lighted sites than dark sites near the new moon, especially around blue-white fluorescent lighting. Most recorded bat species showed increased or unchanged activity in response to light, including some slow-flying and edge-foraging bats. This finding suggests that, contrary to the evaluated hypothesis, flight speed and foraging mode are not sufficient to determine bat responses to artificial lights in the tropics. Two bat species showed decreased activity at light sites, and a low species evenness was recorded around lights, particularly fluorescent lights, compared with dark sites. As in the temperate zone, light pollution in the tropics seems to concentrate certain bat species around human-inhabited areas, potentially shifting community structure.","2019-01","2025-03-03 21:00:14","2025-03-03 21:00:14",NA,"8-17",NA,"1",35,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA Publisher: CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"Chiroptera; cloud forest; Costa Rica; light pollution",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No Decision","No reason given","Measured foraging activity at light and dark sites.

Sound is a critical component of an animal's habitat, where it is used to glean important environmental information from their surroundings. The modification of natural soundscapes due to the global rise in anthropogenic noise pollution over recent decades can have serious negative impacts on species fitness and survival.2. Nocturnal species such as bats are reliant on sound for many aspects of their life history and are, therefore, highly sensitive to anthropogenic noise. Music festivals are a source of unregulated and potentially harmful, acute noise pollution; however, they have become ubiquitous across our landscapes throughout the summer months and are increasingly being held in settings important for wildlife.3. Using an experimental approach, we provide the first evidence of the negative impacts of music festivals on bat activity in a habitat that represents a typical festival setting, that is, woodland edge. We found that loud music playback alone can reduce the activity of bats even in the absence of other anthropogenic factors commonly associated with music festivals such as lighting and habitat disturbance. Activity of Nyctalus/Eptesicus spp. was reduced along woodland edge habitats exposed to loud music, whereas no effect was recorded for Myotis spp., Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus compared with quiet nights. We also provide the first evidence of the spatial scale of negative effects from festival music on activity for P. pygmaeus as well as highlighting differential responses between cryptic species.4. In light of the paucity of research or guidance into acute noise impacts on nocturnal biodiversity, we outline the potential negative impacts of music festivals for bats. We show that music alone can reduce the activity of bats even in the absence of other anthropogenic factors commonly associated with music festivals, which could potentially fragment important habitats for certain species, leading to a degradation of functional connectivity across the landscape.","2023-04","2025-03-03 21:00:14","2025-03-03 21:00:14",NA,"",NA,"2",4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"anthropogenic impacts; bats; biodiversity conservation; Chiroptera; festivals; foraging; music; noise pollution; urbanisation",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","Focus on the impacts of sound pollution - festival music, rather than of light.

However, the effect of moonlight on animal activity is rarely evaluated in human-modified landscapes and can be of vital importance to understand possible changes in ecosystem services provided by light-sensitive taxa, such as insectivorous bats. Fragmentation changes forest structure and affects light penetration across the landscape. In this case, the effects of fragmentation on bat activity can be modulated by cyclical variations of moonlight intensity. We acoustically quantified the activity of nine aerial insectivorous bat species in relation to moonlight at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, Central Amazonia. We aimed to understand species-level variation in activity across habitats (continuous forest, fragments and secondary forest) at different temporal scales: lunar cycle, dark vs. bright nights and within nights. Amazonian aerial insectivorous bats responded more to habitat type than to moonlight, with two and six species showing reduced activity in fragments and secondary forest, respectively, compared to continuous forest. The lower activity in secondary forest suggests that despite c. 30 years of secondary forest regeneration, it is still less attractive as foraging habitat. An interactive effect of habitat type and moonlight on bat activity was most evident when contrasting dark and bright nights. Our results indicate that fragments have reduced bat activity on extremely bright nights, probably due to higher predation risk in small fragments. Species that emit constant-frequency calls (Pteronotus spp.) were the ones that most modulated their responses to habitat disturbance and moonlight. Otherwise, moonlight had little effect on hourly activity levels, irrespective of habitat type. Moonlight is capable of modulating the responses of some bat species in disturbed habitats, particularly in fragments.","2021-12","2025-03-03 21:00:14","2025-03-03 21:00:14",NA,"1046-1058",NA,"6",24,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"acoustic monitoring; anthropogenic impact; bat conservation; habitat fragmentation; light pollution; moonlight; tropical forest",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","Considered affect of fragmentation on natural light levels rather than artificial light.

Understanding the implications of this disturbance for species and populations is crucial for conservation biologists wishing to mitigate negative effects. Anthropogenic light pollution is an increasing global problem [2], affecting ecological interactions across a range of taxa and impacting negatively upon critical animal behaviors including foraging, reproduction, and communication (for review see [2, 3]). Almost all bats are nocturnal [4], making them ideal subjects for testing the effects of light pollution. Previous studies have shown that bat species adapted to foraging in open environments feed on insects attracted to mercury vapor lamps. Here, we use an experimental approach to provide the first evidence of a negative effect of artificial light pollution on the commuting behavior of a threatened bat species. We installed high-pressure sodium lights that mimic the intensity and light spectra of streetlights along commuting routes of lesser horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus hipposideros). Bat activity was reduced dramatically and the onset of commuting behavior was delayed in the presence of lighting, with no evidence of habituation. These results demonstrate that light pollution may have significant negative impacts upon the selection of flight routes by bats.","2009-07-14","2025-03-03 21:00:14","2025-03-03 21:00:14",NA,"1123-1127",NA,"13",19,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 600 TECHNOLOGY SQUARE, 5TH FLOOR, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA Publisher: CELL PRESS Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No Decision","No reason given","Measured commuting behaviour (and maybe activity?) with artificial lights.

While the spatial ecology of bats has received much attention, less is known about their temporal ecology, the knowledge being dispersed in studies of limited taxonomical, spatial and temporal range. We used data from the French bat monitoring program based on citizen science and standardised acoustic recordings (4409 sites monitored and 9807 nights monitored from 2014 to 2020) to characterise the diel activity patterns of 20 bat species so that their consideration in mitigation measures can help conservation. We designed a method to extract times of key descriptors and describe bat activity distribution throughout the night. We found that bat species could be separated in three functional groups characterised by a crepuscular activity, an activity that occurs when it is completely dark or an intermediate activity. We showed variations of diel activity patterns depending on season. We argue that accounting for these complex diel activity patterns would help design efficient mitigation measures, for instance to reduce the exposure of bats to light pollution or wind turbines. Overall, we advocate multi-taxa approaches to design conservation policies adapted to both the temporal and spatial distributions of species.","2023-01","2025-03-03 21:00:14","2025-03-03 21:00:14",NA,"",NA,"",277,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND Publisher: ELSEVIER SCI LTD Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"Bats; Chiroptera; Citizen science; Diel activity pattern; Mitigation measures; Passive acoustic monitoring",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No Decision","No reason given","Recorded diel activity patterns over time, but I do not think they considered it in response to ALAN but instead said it should be consered when mitigating effects of ALAN.

Did it spread to `patient zero' through proactive human-animal contact? Why did humans faced an increasing number of zoonotic diseases in the past few decades? In this article, we propose a new theory by which human pollution such as artificial lighting and noise accentuate pathogen shedding from bats and other wild habitants in urban environments. This theory differs from the current hypothesis that wildlife trades and bushmeat consumption largely contribute to the spillover of zoonotic pathogens to humans. As natural reservoirs, bats harbor the greatest number of zoonotic viruses among all mammalian orders, while they also have a unique immune system to maintain functioning. Some bat species roost in proximity with human settlements, including urban communities and surrounding areas that are potentially most impacted by anthropogenic activities. We review the behavioral changes of wild habitants, including bats and other species, caused by environmental pollution such as artificial lighting and noise pollution, with focus on the spillover of zoonotic pathogens to humans. We found that there is a strong positive correlation between environmental stress and the behavior and health conditions of wild species, including bats. Specifically, artificial lighting attracts insectivorous bats to congregate around streetlights, resulting in changes in their diets and improved likelihood of close contact with humans and animals. Moreover, many bat species avoid lit areas by expending more energies on commuting and foraging. Noise pollution has similar effects on bat behavior. Bats exposed to chronic noise pollution have weakened immune functions, increased viral shedding, and declined immunity during pregnancy, lactation, and vulnerable periods due to noised-induced stress. Other wild species exposed to artificial lighting and noise pollution also show stress-induced behaviors and deteriorated health. Overall, evidence supports our hypothesis that artificial lighting and noise pollution have been overlooked as long-term contributors to the spillover of zoonotic pathogens to humans in urban environments.","2021-12","2025-03-03 21:00:14","2025-03-03 21:00:14",NA,"4021-4030",NA,"6",19,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY Publisher: SPRINGER HEIDELBERG Type: Review",NA,NA,NA,"Artificial lighting; Bat; Coronavirus; Noise pollution; SARS-CoV-2; Spillover",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","Not relevant - focuses instead on impact of ALAN on disease management and zoonoses.

As bats exhibit species-specific responses to the surrounding landscape, tied closely to their morphology and foraging mode, the activity and distribution patterns of bats, and consequently the ecosystem services they provide, are influenced by the landscape characteristics.ObjectivesThis study aims to determine which features in the landscape surrounding rice fields influence the activity levels of insectivorous bats, and at what scales they are most influential.MethodsWe collected acoustic recordings to determine activity levels of seven bat sonotypes in rice fields surrounded by a variety of land-cover types in the Nagaon district of Assam, India. Using this, we determined the most important set of features in the surrounding landscape, and the scales at which had the strongest impact, for each sonotype.ResultsOur results suggest that tree cover variables are the most important predictors of bat activity in rice fields. Distance to nearest forest, area of forest within 1 km, distance to nearest forest edge, and landscape heterogeneity influenced all five of the analysed bat sonotypes. Also important were the amount of urban land within 1 km, which exerted a negative effect on the activity of one sonotype, and moonlight activity, which negatively influenced the activity levels of one sonotype.ConclusionOur results demonstrate that when flying over rice fields, bat activity is most influenced by presence and proximity of trees.

Bat activity was greater at the lower two most eutrophied sites, and greatest at the residential (urban) site. Laephotis capensis, , an urban-adapted species, was by far the most active, probably on account of both insensitivity to light pollution, and roost-site availability.

Data showed that the east and center area of the city had the lower species richness and relative abundance, while south was the richest. This diversity patterns were in response to different habitat characteristics, mainly those related to landscape. However, activities and permanence were strongly related with human presence. The bat permanence modeled, indicated that bat community structure could be shaped under changing scenarios.

Artificial lights are suspected to have substantial effects on the ecology of many species, e.g., by producing discontinuities in the territories of nocturnal animals. We analyzed the potential influence of the intensity and type of artificial light on bat activity in a semi-natural landscape in France. We used a species approach, followed by a trait-based approach, to light sensitivity. We also investigated whether the effect of light could be related to foraging traits. We performed acoustic surveys at sites located along a gradient of light intensities to assess the activity of 15 species of bats. We identified 2 functional response groups of species: one group that was light-tolerant and one group that was light-intolerant. Among the species in the latter group that appear to be disadvantaged by lighting conditions, many are rare and threatened in Europe, whereas the species from the former group are better able to thrive in disturbed habitats such as lighted areas and may actually benefit from artificial lighting. Finally, several methods of controlling light pollution are suggested for the conservation of bat communities. Recommendations for light management and the creation of dim-light corridors are proposed; these strategies may play an important role in protecting against the impact of light pollution on nocturnal animals.","2014-10-31","2025-03-03 21:00:15","2025-03-03 21:00:15",NA,"",NA,"10",9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA Publisher: PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No Decision","No reason given","Analysed influence of type and intensity of artificial light on bat activity.

Nous avons defini deux groupes fonctionnels alimentation des chauves-souris en fonction de leurs cris d'echolocalisation: 1) les butineuses en plein air (famille Molossidae) ayant les cris low duty cycle a bande etroite, de frequence basse, et 2) les butineuses au bord de l'encombrement (familles Miniopteridae et Vespertilionidae), ayant les cris high duty cycle a large bande, de frequence plus elevee.

L'activite totale chauve-souris et l'activite des groupes fonctionnels varient considerablement entre les saisons, la plus haute etant en ete et en automne (coincidant avec des pics annuels en nombre de punaises, Bathycoelia natalicola et Nezara spp, ordre Heteroptera, famille Pentatomidae, et les pyrales de noix de macadamia, Cryptophlebia ombrodelta, ordre Lepidotera) et inferieures en hiver et au printemps.

Recent studies have indicated that species show varying responses to urbanisation, with a few able to exploit man-made structures and adjust to the new environmental conditions. This study aimed to identify how landscape composition influences bat diversity and community structure along the urbanisation gradient in a coastal Mediterranean city (Patras, Greece) and whether particular species benefit from the novel conditions. We conducted acoustic surveys along 45 transects during the post-breeding season for two years. The effect of land cover, the number of streetlamps (a proxy of artificial illumination), the presence of water bodies and weather conditions on bat activity, and community structure were investigated using Generalized Linear Mixed Models, and multivariate statistics respectively. Eight bat species and five species groups were identified. Bat communities were affected by urbanisation in general and diversity was low in the entire study area. The community was dominated by the synurbic species Pipistrellus kuhlii, which comprised more than 70% of the total bat activity recorded. A positive relationship between built-up areas and bat activity was found, probably because P. kuhlii usually forages around streetlamps in urban areas. In contrast, vegetation cover did not affect bat activity, even in the less urbanised areas. The remainder of the bat species were not frequently recorded and were mostly detected close to water bodies, highlighting their value for foraging bats and the need for their conservation.","2019","2025-03-03 21:00:15","2025-03-03 21:00:15",NA,"134-140",NA,"2",30,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: C/O GIOVANNI AMORI, CNR-ISE VIALE DELL UNIVERSITA 23, ROMA, I-00185, ITALY Publisher: ASSOC TERIOLOGICA ITALIANA Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"land cover; Mediterranean basin; Pipistrellus kuhlii; urbanisation gradient; water bodies",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No Decision","No reason given","Affect of number of street lamps on bat activity.

Artificial water sites such as urban ponds provide foraging and drinking resources to synurbic wildlife, among which bats stand out as an important group. Availability of water sources may thus strongly influence the persistence of animal populations in urban habitats. Pond characteristics, as well as landscape structural patterns in the surrounding area, may modulate the use of such water sites by bats. We investigated bat species richness and activity levels in a pond archipelago within the city of Rome, one of the largest urban areas in Italy. We hypothesized that the presence of woody vegetation and hedgerows affects activity rates over ponds and that bat responses to habitat and landscape structures as well as artificial illumination are species-specific. Bat species richness was mainly influenced by the availability of wooded vegetation within 1000 m around ponds, with minor effects of the amount of bank habitat, while bat activity was affected by different habitat features in a species-specific way. All species responded positively to pond proximity to linear landscape elements such as hedgerows and to the amount of bank habitat. The presence of natural banks, the amount of woodland and that of open green areas positively influenced the activity of different species at different scales, while distances between ponds and artificial lights had a species-specific effect direction.

Most bat species are threatened by urbanisation, although urban areas can also offer important roosting and foraging opportunities. Urban development should consider how bats are likely to respond to development, and take measures to minimise impacts. We used acoustic data from four years of citizen science monitoring (2013-2016) to quantify the importance of fine-scale habitat configuration and composition for bats in urban areas in eastern England. Bat distribution and activity were analysed in relation to remote sensing data representing impervious surface, waterbodies and tree-cover density. Furthermore, hypothetical future scenarios of urban development were considered, assuming an increase in impervious or woodland surface. Lakes and discontinuous woodland were the most selected habitats and urban areas were the least selected, with Barbastellus, Myotis and Plecotus species being the most vulnerable. Nyctalus, Pipistrellus and Eptesicus species were less influenced by the presence of urban areas. Our results suggest that urban growth should be sought through the expansion of existing urban blocks, rather than creating new urban patches, to minimise impacts on commuting or foraging sites. Creating bat-friendly habitat of an area at least equal to any new urban settlement could provide mitigation for negative effects of urbanisation. Opportunities to increase areas of discontinuous woodland should be encouraged, while preserving unmanaged areas within large plantations would likely support the exploitation of continuous woodland by bats.","2020-01","2025-03-03 21:00:15","2025-03-03 21:00:15",NA,"",NA,"",241,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND Publisher: ELSEVIER SCI LTD Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"Acoustic monitoring; Chiroptera; Citizen science; Mitigation; Urban planning",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","No consideration of ALAN","Insert Screener Name"

As the orientation of bats is impeded around smooth surfaces, the exploitation of solar farms as foraging habitats by bats needs research. We surveyed the activity of bats at solar farms and in the neighboring habitats (forests, grasslands, arable fields, settlements and watersides) to evaluate the effects of solar farms on the occurrence and activity of bats and on the composition of bat communities. We conducted bioacoustic surveys at 190 sites in 15 areas of Hungary and recorded nearly 30 000 bat echolocation call sequences. We detected patterns of overall bat activity similar to those in other open habitats such as arable land and grassland indicating that some bat species can exploit this anthropogenic environment. Bat species detected at solar farms also frequently occur in arable land and settlements (Hypsugo savii, Nyctalus noctula and Pipistrellus kuhlii), suggesting that bats adapted to anthropogenic environments exploit solar farms.

Bats developed ultrasonic echolocation to hunt, and in response some arthropods developed defense mechanisms such as ultrasonic hearing, allowing them to elude bat predators. The present study analyzes the feeding patterns of bats, focusing on sonic-auditory sensory mechanisms in predator-prey interactions. Next-generation DNA sequence data from fecal samples were used to analyze the diet of 17 bat species from Mexico. Arthropod prey taxa were classified according to their auditory traits, and echolocation data were recompiled from literature review. We: (i) classified arthropod families according to their hearing ability; (ii) estimated arthropod taxon richness and proportion in the diet of each bat species; and (iii) used multidimensional scaling, principal component analysis, and regression to analyze prey consumption patterns in relation to their auditory traits and in relation to echolocation characteristics of bats. Finally, we analyzed the relationship between foraging time and auditory characteristics of prey. Families with hearing organs correspond to the orders Lepidoptera and Orthoptera. We registered 20 families of Lepidoptera and 5 of Orthoptera-7 and 3 with hearing organs, respectively. Of these orders, families lacking ears were recorded in the diet of a few bat species. Our results support the allotonic frequency hypothesis predicting a difference in emission frequency intervals between predator and prey. However, we found that the consumption of earless moths is less frequent and is related to diurnal and twilight activity-hence, their consumption is limited to bat species foraging early. Results indicate bats feed on arthropod prey successfully despite the ultrasonic hearing ability of the prey. These results may be due to counteradaptations that allow maintenance of an asymmetric “arms race” between bats and eared insects that favors the predator.

The disease's name derives from a visually apparent white growth of the newly discovered fungus Geomyces destructans on the skin (including the muzzle) of hibernating bats(1,3). Colonization of skin by this fungus is associated with characteristic cutaneous lesions that are the only consistent pathological finding related to WNS4. However, the role of G. destructans in WNS remains controversial because evidence to implicate the fungus as the primary cause of this disease is lacking. The debate is fuelled, in part, by the assumption that fungal infections in mammals are most commonly associated with immune system dysfunction(5-7). Additionally, the recent discovery that G. destructans commonly colonizes the skin of bats of Europe, where no unusual bat mortality events have been reported(8-10), has generated further speculation that the fungus is an opportunistic pathogen and that other unidentified factors are the primary cause of WNS11,12. Here we demonstrate that exposure of healthy little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) to pure cultures of G. destructans causes WNS. Live G. destructans was subsequently cultured from diseased bats, successfully fulfilling established criteria for the determination of G. destructans as a primary pathogen(13). We also confirmed that WNS can be transmitted from infected bats to healthy bats through direct contact. Our results provide the first direct evidence that G. destructans is the causal agent of WNS and that the recent emergence of WNS in North America may represent translocation of the fungus to a region with a naive population of animals(8). Demonstration of causality is an instrumental step in elucidating the pathogenesis(14) and epidemiology(15) of WNS and in guiding management actions to preserve bat populations against the novel threat posed by this devastating infectious disease.","2011-12-15","2025-03-03 21:00:15","2025-03-03 21:00:15",NA,"376-U129",NA,"7377",480,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","Experiment looking at the disease WNS.

Nine of the roosts, including two used by a maternity colony (ca. 30 females), were located between overlapping boards on the gables of barns. The remaining eight roosts, all used by single individuals, were under lose bark on thin trees (DBH = 0.2-0.35 m). All recorded roosts had entrances pointing downwards, were adjacent to deciduous trees providing protective darkness, and were in areas without artificial lighting. In the barns, the bats avoided the northern aspect, which is the lightest (sun sets in the NW and rises in the NE). Roost temperatures did not differ between tree- and barn roosts. Average ambient light intensity on emergence and return was 13.3 lux (SD = 10.1 lux). Roosts in trees and barns shared common physical characteristics, yet despite this both maternity roosts were located in barns, perhaps because such roosts had more space than available tree roosts. Our results suggest that in areas deprived of large trees and extensive old forest, barbastelle shows flexibility in roost selection, although they consistently avoid artificial lights of all kinds.

The disease primarily affects cave-hibernating bats by depleting fat reserves during hibernation and causing a range of other physiological consequences when immune responses are suppressed. Since it was first detected in 2006, the disease has killed millions of bats and is responsible for extensive local extinctions. To better understand the effects of white-nose syndrome on various bat species, we analyzed summer acoustic survey data collected from 2016 to 2020 at nine US National Parks within the Great Lakes region. We examined the effect that white-nose syndrome, time of the year relative to pup volancy, habitat type, and regional variation (i.e., park) have on the acoustic abundance (i.e., mean call abundance) of six bat species. As expected, little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) and northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis), both hibernating species, experienced a significant decline in acoustic abundance following white-nose syndrome detection. We observed a significant increase in acoustic abundance as white-nose syndrome progressed for hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus) and silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans), both migratory species that are not impacted by the disease. Contrary to our predictions, we observed an increase in big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus; hibernating) acoustic abundance and a decrease in eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis; migratory) acoustic abundance following the detection of white-nose syndrome. We did not observe any significant changes after the onset of white-nose syndrome in the seasonal patterns of acoustic activity related to pup volancy, suggesting that production or recruitment of young may not be affected by the disease. Our results suggest that white-nose syndrome is affecting the acoustic abundance of certain species; however, these changes may not be a result of reduced reproductive success caused by the disease. In addition, species population dynamics may be indirectly affected by white-nose syndrome as a result of reduced competition or a foraging niche release. We also found that for parks located at higher latitudes, little brown bat and northern long-eared bat were more likely to experience greater declines in acoustic abundance as a result of white-nose syndrome. Our work provides insight into species-specific responses to white-nose syndrome at a regional scale and examines factors that may facilitate resistance or resiliency to the disease.","2023-07","2025-03-03 21:00:15","2025-03-03 21:00:15",NA,"",NA,"7",13,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"acoustic activity; bats; disease; latitude; Pseudogymnoascus destructans",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","Study on WNS.

Here, we examine the transmission dynamics of an emerging zoonotic paramyxovirus, Hendra virus (HeV), in its endemic host, Australian Pteropus bats (fruit bats or flying foxes). HeV is a biosecurity level 4 (BSL-4) pathogen, with a high case-fatality rate in humans and horses. With models parametrized from field and laboratory data, we explore a set of probable contributory mechanisms that explain the spatial and temporal pattern of HeV emergence; including urban habituation and decreased migration-two widely observed changes in flying fox ecology that result from anthropogenic transformation of bat habitat in Australia. Urban habituation increases the number of flying foxes in contact with human and domestic animal populations, and our models suggest that, in addition, decreased bat migratory behaviour could lead to a decline in population immunity, giving rise to more intense outbreaks after local viral reintroduction. Ten of the 14 known HeV outbreaks occurred near urbanized or sedentary flying fox populations, supporting these predictions. We also demonstrate that by incorporating waning maternal immunity into our models, the peak modelled prevalence coincides with the peak annual spill-over hazard for HeV. These results provide the first detailed mechanistic framework for understanding the sporadic temporal pattern of HeV emergence, and of the urban/peri-urban distribution of HeV outbreaks in horses and people.","2011-12-22","2025-03-03 21:00:15","2025-03-03 21:00:15",NA,"3703-3712",NA,"1725",278,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND Publisher: ROYAL SOC Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"bat virus; connectivity; flying fox; Hendra virus; metapopulation disease model; Pteropus",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","Study of zoonoses.","Insert Screener Name"

Urgent steps are still needed for the mitigation or control of Pd to save bats. We hypothesized that a focus on fungal community would advance the understanding of ecology and ecosystem processes that are crucial in the disease transmission cycle. This study was conducted in 2010-2011 in New York and Vermont using 90 samples from four mines and two caves situated within the epicenter of WNS. We used culture-dependent (CD) and culture-independent (CI) methods to catalogue all fungi ('mycobiome'). CD methods included fungal isolations followed by phenotypic and molecular identifications. CI methods included amplification of DNA extracted from environmental samples with universal fungal primers followed by cloning and sequencing. CD methods yielded 675 fungal isolates and CI method yielded 594 fungal environmental nucleic acid sequences (FENAS). The core mycobiome of WNS comprised of 136 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) recovered in culture and 248 OTUs recovered in clone libraries. The fungal community was diverse across the sites, although a subgroup of dominant cosmopolitan fungi was present. The frequent recovery of Pd (18% of samples positive by culture) even in the presence of dominant, cosmopolitan fungal genera suggests some level of local adaptation in WNS-afflicted habitats, while the extensive distribution of Pd (48% of samples positive by real-time PCR) suggests an active reservoir of the pathogen at these sites. These findings underscore the need for integrated disease control measures that target both bats and Pd in the hibernacula for the control of WNS.","2014-09-29","2025-03-03 21:00:15","2025-03-03 21:00:15",NA,"",NA,"9",9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA Publisher: PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","Study of WNS","Insert Screener Name"

There were many rumors that SARS-CoV-2 was human-borne and its evolution was predicted many years ago, but scientific investigation proved them wrong and concluded that bats might be the origin of SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins act as intermediary species to transmit the virus from bats to humans. Airborne droplets were found to be the leading cause of human-to-human transmission of this virus, but later studies showed that contaminated surfaces and other environmental factors are also involved in its transmission. The evolution of different SARS-CoV-2 variants worsens the condition and has become a challenge to overcome this pandemic.

We conducted a molecular epidemiology study to investigate different genotypes and potential recombination in HCoV-OC43. Twenty-nine HCoV-OC43 strains from nasopharyngeal aspirates, collected from 2004 to 2011, were subjected to RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike, and nucleocapsid gene analysis. Phylogenetic analysis showed at least three distinct clusters of HCoV-OC43, although 10 unusual strains displayed incongruent phylogenetic positions between RdRp and spike genes. This suggested the presence of four HCoV-OC43 genotypes (A to D), with genotype D most likely arising from recombination. The complete genome sequencing of two genotype C and D strains and bootscan analysis showed recombination events between genotypes B and C in the generation of genotype D. Of the 29 strains, none belonged to the more ancient genotype A, 5 from 2004 belonged to genotype B, 15 from 2004 to 2006 belonged to genotype C, and 1 from 2004 and all 8 from 2008 to 2011 belonged to the recombinant genotype D. Molecular clock analysis using spike and nucleocapsid genes dated the most recent common ancestor of all genotypes to the 1950s, genotype B and C to the 1980s, genotype B to the 1990s, and genotype C to the late 1990s to early 2000s, while the recombinant genotype D strains were detected as early as 2004.

Recent outbreaks of YF in Kenya (1992-1993) and Sudan (2003 and 2005) are important because each of these outbreaks have involved the re-emergence of a YFV genotype (East Africa) that remained undetected for nearly 40 years and was previously unconfirmed in a clinically apparent outbreak.
