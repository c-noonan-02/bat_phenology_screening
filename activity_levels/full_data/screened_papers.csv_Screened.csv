Insectivorous bats are strictly nocturnal animals that are vulnerable to disruption from artificial light. Given that many light-sensitive bats tend to avoid night light during roost departure, it is often assumed that nighttime light pollution reduces their foraging opportunities, albeit empirical evidence in support of this hypothesis remains elusive. Here, we used least horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus pusillus, to assess whether white artificial light is detrimental for the opportunities of foraging. We manipulated the levels of ambient illumination and perceived predation risk inside the bat roost. We monitored bats' emergence activity using high-speed video and audio recording systems. DNA based faecal dietary analysis and insect survey were applied to determine activity time of prey in foraging areas. Following experimentally manipulation of white light-emitting diode (LED) lighting 0-15 min after sunset, bat pass, flight duration, and echolocation pulse emission decreased. The mean emergence time of bats flying out was delayed by 14 min under lit treatment compared with the dark control. Only 10% of bats left for foraging during 40 min of light exposure. Aversive effects of LED light on bat emergence were robust regardless of the presence of a potential predator. Insect prey reached a peak of abundance between 30 and 60 min after sunset. These results demonstrate that white artificial light hinders evening emergence behavior in least horseshoe bats, leading to a mismatch between foraging onset and peak food availability. Our findings highlight that light pollution overrides foraging onset, suggesting the importance of improving artificial lighting scheme near the roosts of light-sensitive bats.","01/11/2021","03/03/2025 21:00","03/03/2025 21:00",NA,"",NA,"",288,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ELSEVIER SCI LTD Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"Bat; Emergence; Foraging opportunity; Light pollution; Photophobic behavior",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","","Can extract mean number of bat passes from dark and light treatments from figure 2a.","Insert Screener Name"

ALAN can have major effects on nocturnal communities, including insects and bats. Insects are attracted to street lights and few bat species take advantage of this by foraging on the attracted insects. ALAN potentially affects the temporal patterns of insect abundance and thereby bat foraging behaviour. In a natural dark environment, these patterns are usually bimodal, with an activity peak in the early evening and the morning. Little is known about how ALAN affects insect presence throughout the night, and whether the light spectrum plays a role. This is important, as these temporal changes may be a key driver of disturbances in bat-insect interactions. Here, we studied how white and red light affect insects' and bats' nightly activity patterns. The activity of insects and bats (Pipistrellus spp.) was recorded throughout the night at seven experimentally illuminated sites in a forest-edge ecosystem. ALAN disrupted activity patterns, with both insects and bats being more active throughout the night. ALAN facilitated all-night foraging in bats especially near white light, but these effects were attenuated near red light. The ability to forage throughout the night may be a key advantage causing synanthropic bats to dominate in illuminated environments, but this could also prove detrimental in the long term. As red light reduced disturbing effects of ALAN on insects and bats diel activity pattern, it opens the possibility of using spectral composition as a mitigation measure.","25/08/2024","03/03/2025 21:00","03/03/2025 21:00",NA,"",NA,"",940,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS Publisher: ELSEVIER Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"Bats; Foraging behaviour; Insects; Light colour; Light pollution; Prey-predator interaction",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","White light and dark control light treatments.

Using video and audio recording, we monitored foraging onset, total foraging time, food consumption, freezing behavior (temporary cessation of body movement), and echolocation vocalizations in triads of bats under each lighting condition. Analyses showed that the foraging activities of experimental bats were reduced under LED light. Green, yellow, and red light had greater negative effects on bats' foraging onset, total foraging time, and food consumption than white and blue light. LED light of different spectra induced increased freezing time and echolocation vocalizations in captive bats, except for the white light.

However, it is an environmental pollutant to many wildlife species. We found that in the city artificial light at night attracted insects, which could be a source of food for bats. However, whether bats could use this food source depended on their ability to navigate through objects in space. We found that bats that preferred open habitats did not fully use insects attracted by artificial light at night when foraging sites were cluttered by fences, billboards, and other objects. In contrast, bats that were considered not to benefit from artificial light at night could take advantage of cluttered sites and be more active and forage more. Lastly, there were a few species absent in our study, which could be light-sensitive and not adaptive to urban environments. We suggest that limiting or reducing artificial light at night is needed to conserve bats. Predators respond to the increase of prey by aggregation in space or foraging more often. However, foraging habitat suitability limits predators' responses. For nocturnal insectivorous bats, artificial light at night (ALAN) can trigger insect prey aggregation. It is not clear how ALAN might affect predator-prey relationships in the urban setting, where urban bats could have adapted to the city, and novel spatial complexity introduced by man-made objects might alter foraging habitat suitability. We strategically selected sites to represent different levels of ALAN and spatial complexity. We recorded bat commuting and foraging activities and collected aerial insects to examine how ALAN and spatial complexity affected bat-insect relationships. We found that insect biomass was positively correlated with ALAN, but was not affected by spatial complexity. Large-sized big brown bats and hoary bats positively responded to change of prey in open sites whereas small-sized eastern red bats and silver-haired bats positively responded in cluttered sites, suggesting that the impact of ALAN could vary when ALAN is coupled with urban spatial complexity. Our study demonstrates that foraging habitat suitability can alter which species might benefit from ALAN. Predator-prey relationships in cities are complex, but general ecological principles still apply in novel urban ecosystems.","2022-06","03/03/2025 21:00","03/03/2025 21:00",NA,"",NA,"6",11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"ALAN; artificial light at night; bats; foraging activity; insects; predator-prey relationships; spatial complexity; trophic dynamics; urban",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","Used distances from light sources as the measure of ALAN.

The response of bats to ALAN ranges from some opportunistic species taking advantage of insect aggregations around street lamps, particularly those emitting ultraviolet (UV) light, to others avoiding lit areas at all. Tree cover has been suggested to mitigate the negative effects of ALAN on bats by shielding areas against light scatter. Here, we investigated the effect of tree cover on the relationship between ALAN and bats in Berlin, Germany. In particular, we asked if this interaction varies with the UV light spectrum of street lamps and also across urban bat species. We expected trees next to street lamps to block ALAN, making the adjacent habitat more suitable for all species, irrespective of the wavelength spectrum of the light source. Additionally, we expected UV emitting lights next to trees to attract insects and thus, opportunistic bats. In summer 2017, we recorded bat activity at 22 green open spaces in Berlin using automated ultrasonic detectors. We analyzed bat activity patterns and landscape variables (number of street lamps with and without UV light emission, an estimate of light pollution, and tree cover density around each recording site within different spatial scales) using generalized linear mixed-effects models with a negative binomial distribution. We found a species-specific response of bats to street lamps with and without UV light, providing a more detailed picture of ALAN impacts than simply total light radiance. Moreover, we found that dense tree cover dampened the negative effect of street lamps without UV for open-space foraging bats of the genera Nyctalus, Eptesicus, and Vespertilio, yet it amplified the already existing negative or positive effect of street lamps with or without UV on Pipistrellus pipistrellus, P. pygmaeus, and Myotis spp. Our study underpins the importance of minimizing artificial light at night close to vegetation, particularly for bats adapted to spatial complexity in the environment (i.e., clutter-adapted species), and to increase dense vegetation in urban landscape to provide, besides roosting opportunities, protection against ALAN for open-space foraging bats in city landscapes.","27/03/2019","03/03/2025 21:00","03/03/2025 21:00",NA,"",NA,"",7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"ALAN; bats; canopy cover; chiroptera; light-emitting diodes; trees; ultraviolet light; urban",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","Looked at streetlamps - not light/dark treatments.","Insert Screener Name"

We also provide the first evidence of negative effects of PNL on both feeding and activity for Pipistrellus pipistrellus which has previously been recorded feeding under artificial light. Despite having considerable energy-saving benefits, we outline the potential negative impacts of PNL schemes for bats in riparian habitats. PNL are unlikely to provide desired conservation outcomes for bats, and can potentially fragment important foraging habitats leading to a breakdown of functional connectivity across the landscape.

To determine whether long-tailed bat behaviour was affected by ALAN, a small-scale study was conducted on the fringe of Hamilton City, New Zealand, using LED floodlights.

We recorded 2549 drinking events from 12 species or species groups, most of which decreased drinking activity under illumination. The effects of ALAN on drinking were stronger than on foraging. Forest species never drank when the light was on. Edge-foraging species reduced drinking activity while also increasing foraging under lit conditions.

However, at night such resources may lose attractiveness when they are in artificially lit areas. For bats, attraction to such manmade habitats might be species specific. In an isolated village in the Negev desert that is known for its high bat activity we investigated the effects of artificial lighting on flight behaviour of two aerial insectivorous bat species: Pipistrellus kuhlii, a non-desert synanthropic bat, common in urban environments and Eptesicus bottae, a desert-dwelling species. Using an acoustic tracking system we reconstructed flight trajectories for bats that flew under artificial lights [Light treatment (L)] versus in natural darkness [Dark treatment (D)]. Under L both P. kuhlii and E. bottae flew significantly faster than under D. Under L, P. kuhlii also flew at significantly lower altitude (i.e. away from a floodlight) than under D. Whereas P. kuhlii foraged both in L and D, E. bottae only foraged in D. In L, activity of E. bottae decreased and it merely transited the illuminated area at commuting rather than foraging speed. Thus, under artificially lighted conditions the non-desert synanthropic species may have a competitive advantage over the native desert species and may outcompete it for aerial insect prey. Controlling light pollution in deserts and keeping important foraging sites unlit may reduce the synanthropic species' competitive advantage over native desert bats.","2011-09","03/03/2025 21:00","03/03/2025 21:00",NA,"21-27",NA,"1",285,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY-BLACKWELL Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"desert bats; Eptesicus bottae; flight behaviour; light pollution; Pipistrellus kuhlii",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","Light and dark treatments used.

Thus, artificial lights may change the environment in such a way as to create winners and losers as some species benefit while others do not. Insectivorous bats are nocturnal and a good model to test for differential effects of light pollution on a single community. We used a physiological technique to address this community-level question by measuring plasma ss-hydroxybutyrate (a blood metabolite) concentrations from six species of insectivorous bats in lit and unlit conditions. We also recorded bat calls acoustically to measure activity levels between experimental conditions. Blood metabolite level and acoustic activity data suggest species-specific changes in foraging around lights. In red bats (Lasiurus borealis), ss-hydroxybutyrate levels at lit sites were highest early in the night before decreasing. Acoustic data indicate pronounced peaks in activity at lit sites early in the night. In red bats on dark nights and in the other species in this community, which seem to avoid lights, ss-hydroxybutyrate remained relatively constant. Our results suggest red bats are more willing to expend energy to actively forage around lights despite potential negative impacts, while other, generally rarer species avoid lit areas. Artificial light appears to have a bifurcating effect on bat communities, whereby some species take advantage of concentrated prey resources, yet most do not. Further, this may concentrate light-intolerant species into limited dark refugia, thereby increasing competition for depauperate, phototactic insect communities.","2019-01","03/03/2025 21:00","03/03/2025 21:00",NA,"69-77",NA,"1",189,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"-Hydroxybutyrate; Bat-insect interactions; LED; Light pollution; Plasma metabolite analysis",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","Lit and unlit treatments.

To date, ecological impacts of individual LED properties (color temperature, dimmability) have been studied, while interactions between light properties or aspects of luminaire design have not been addressed. However, the design of luminaires can influence ALAN impacts as the shape determines the spatial distribution of light and its visibility in the environment. This may cause amplifying or mitigating effects. We assessed the relative individual and interacting effects of two LED luminaire designs and three LED color temperatures (1750 K, 3000 K, 4000 K) on nocturnal insect abundance, bat foraging and feeding activity. We considered a standard LED luminaire shape with focused light emission and a luminaire shape with a diffusor to scatter the light spatially, leading to increased visibility of the light in the environment. During 104 nights, we trapped 51263 nocturnal insects of which 97% were caught at lights and 3% at dark sites. For bats, up to 44.8% fewer acoustic signals were recorded at dark sites. We caught 31% insects at LEDs with1750 K, 34% and 35% at 3000 K and 4000 K, respectively. Thus, color temperatures of 1750 K proved less detrimental than 3000/4000 K. Effects of luminaire shape led to an increase (16%) of trapped insects for luminaires with diffusors compared to the standard shape. In addition, luminaires with diffusors amplified the effects of LED color (+12% insects at 1750 K/3000 K; +25.6% at 4000 K). In contrast, bat foraging activity was independent of the light treatments while bat feeding activity was increased by 21.5% at standard luminaire shapes. Likely, intense straylight at diffused lights negatively affects the target-focused echolocation by deterring the bats. We concluded that ecological impacts of luminaire shape are an important, yet underestimated variable in light-pollution impact research.

Although nocturnal animals are most vulnerable, ALAN's effects on North American bats have been surprisingly understudied. Most of what is known is based on decades-old observations of bats around street lights with traditional lighting technologies that have been increasingly replaced by energy-efficient broad-spectrum lighting, rendering our understanding of the contemporary effects of ALAN on North American bats even less complete. We experimentally tested the effects of broad-spectrum ALAN on presence/absence, foraging activity, and species composition in a Connecticut, USA bat community by illuminating foraging habitat with light-emitting diode (LED) floodlights and comparing acoustic recordings between light and dark conditions. Lighting dramatically decreased presence and activity of little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), which we detected on only 14% of light nights compared with 65% of dark (lights off) and 69% of control (lights removed) nights. Big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) activity on light nights averaged only half that of dark and control nights. Lighting did not affect presence/absence of silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans), but decreased their activity. There were no effects on eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis) or hoary bats (L. cinereus), which have been described previously as light-tolerant. Aversion to lighting by some species but not others caused a significant shift in community composition, thereby potentially altering competitive balances from natural conditions. Our results demonstrate that only a small degree of ALAN can represent a significant form of habitat degradation for some North American bats, including the endangered little brown bat. Research on the extent to which different lighting technologies, colors, and intensities affect these species is urgently needed and should be a priority in conservation planning for North America's bats.","2021-05","03/03/2025 21:00","03/03/2025 21:00",NA,"5635-5645",NA,"10",11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"artificial light at night; community composition; emitting diode; light&#8208; Myotis lucifugus",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","Calculated light activity index for several species with light and dark treatments.","Insert Screener Name"

Cave -roosting animals are vulnerable to light pollution due to long-term adaptation to nocturnal niches, and the problem is especially severe in the context of cave tourism and limestone mining. Mitigating the adverse impacts of artificial light on cave -dwelling animals presents a challenge. This study aimed to assess the relative contributions of spectral parameters and light intensity to the emergence behavior of nine cave -roosting bat species: Rhinolophus macrotis, Rhinolophus pearsonii, Rhinolophus rex, Rhinolophus pusillus, Rhinolophus siamensis, Rhinolophus sinicus, Hipposideros armiger, Myotis davidii, and Miniopterus fuliginosus. We manipulated light spectra and intensities through light -emitting diode (LED) lighting and gel filters at the entrance of bat roost. We monitored nightly passes per species to quantify bat emergence under the dark control and ten lighting conditions (blue, green, yellow, red, and white light at high and low intensities) using ultrasonic recording. Our analyses showed that the number of bat passes tended to be reduced in the presence of white, green, and yellow light, independent of light intensity. In contrast, the number of bat passes showed no pronounced differences under the dark control, blue light, and red light. The number of bat passes was primarily affected by LED light's blue component, red component, peak wavelength, and half -width instead of light intensity. These results demonstrate that spectral parameters of LED light can significantly affect emergence behavior of cave -dwelling bats. Our findings highlight the importance of manipulating light colors to reduce the negative impacts of light pollution on cave -roosting bats as a function of their spectral sensitivity.

In otherwise dark environments, street lights restrict the use of major flight routes by some bats, including the threatened lesser horseshoe bat Rhinolophus hipposideros, and may disrupt foraging. Using radio tracking, we examined the response of individual female R. hipposideros to experimental street lights placed on hedgerows used as major flight routes. Hedgerows were illuminated on one side over four nights using lights with different emission spectra, while the opposite side of the hedge was not illuminated. Automated bat detectors were used to examine changes in overall bat activity by R. hipposideros and other bat species present. R. hipposideros activity reduced significantly under all light types, including red light, challenging a previously held assumption that red light is safe for bats. Despite this, R. hipposideros rapidly adapted to the presence of lights by switching their flight paths to the dark side of the hedgerow, enabling them to reach foraging sites without restriction. Red light had no effect on the activity of the other species present. Slow-flying Myotis spp. avoided orange, white and green light, while more agile Pipistrellus spp. were significantly more active at these light types compared to dark controls, most probably in response to accumulations of insect prey. No effect of any light type was found for Nyctalus or Eptesicus spp. Our findings demonstrate that caution must be used when promoting forms of lighting that are thought to be safe for wildlife before they are tested more widely.

Human footprint can reduce animal movement through barrier effects such as habitat change and fragmentation, or through enhanced resources. Artificial light at night (ALAN) can affect the movement of nocturnal animals such as bats that are highly mobile in the landscape. Very few studies have explicitly quantified the choices that moving bats make when they encounter a light source on their flight routes. We assessed whether ALAN of different colours (green, red and white) compared to control conditions affected the use of ecological corridors, considering (i) activity and (ii) movement along the corridor, for open, edge (i.e. light-opportunistic) and narrow-space (i.e. light-averse) foraging bats. We modelled the effects of 28 independent lampposts at four experimental sites on bat activity and movement (i.e. the number of trajectories towards the lamppost and the probability of lamppost crossing). Each lamppost was sampled two to three times over eight complete nights using paired passive acoustic stereo recorders to record bat activity and reconstruct bat trajectories. Narrow-space foragers were much less active in presence of any light source, and fewer flew towards any lit lampposts. Open and edge-space foragers were more active close to white and green lights, and to a lesser extent red light, compared to unlit control sites. Edge-space foragers overall flew more towards white and green lampposts, but had a lower probability of fully crossing a white and red-lighted site. The study shows that ALAN can strongly alter bat movements along landscape structures, for light-averse but also light-opportunistic species. Such changes in flight behaviour may involve bypasses or detours, which may force bats to fly longer distances at night which could ultimately affect fitness. Our findings suggest that avoiding artificial lighting close to flight routes will benefit bats.","2023-12","03/03/2025 21:00","03/03/2025 21:00",NA,"865-875",NA,"6",26,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"artificial light; barrier effect; bat movement; Chiroptera; ecological corridors; flight behaviour; functional connectivity; streetlight crossing",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","White and dark treatments.

ALAN also affects bat drinking activity, at least when lighting occurs over short intervals. We tested whether continuous illumination of drinking sites over 4-h periods would lead bats to tolerate ALAN and resume drinking in the course of the night. We conducted our experiments in forest (Italy) and desert (Israel) sites to test whether in the latter habitat, where water is scarce, a greater motivation to drink might lead to less adverse bat reactions. We recorded 6853 drinking buzzes and 1647 feeding buzzes from 17 species and one species group. In the forest sites, species that hunt in open spaces or along forest edges showed little (P. pipistrellus and H. savii) or no (P. kuhlii and N. leisleri) drinking activity decrease, while those associated with forest interiors (Barbastella barbastellus, Plecotus auritus and bats in the genus Myotis) exhibited a strong negative response. In the desert sites, all studied species reduced drinking activity, yet in the desert populations of P. kuhlii we recorded stronger adverse reactions only far from human settlements. The harsh reactions that the desert bat species showed towards ALAN rule out any effect of a greater motivation to drink. Illumination had no effect on foraging by most species, except in the forest sites, where Pipistrellus kuhlii and Nyctalus leisleri increased foraging when the light was on, and in the desert sites, where Hypsugo bodenheimeri decreased foraging in such situations. The progressive human encroachment that is taking place in many world regions on both forests and especially deserts, where few sites for drinking are available, may jeopardize bat populations also through increased exposure to ALAN.","2019-04","03/03/2025 21:00","03/03/2025 21:00",NA,"124-133",NA,"2",22,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"Chiroptera; foraging; habituation; Israel; Italy; light pollution; urbanization; water",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","Mean drinking activity of different species at lit and unlit treatments - extract from Fig 2","Insert Screener Name"

In addition, new data from large-scale surveys involving more than 265 000 bat calls at more than 600 locations in two countries are presented, showing that prevalent street-lighting types are not generally linked with increased activity of common and widespread bat species. Such bats, which are important to ecosystem function, are generally considered `light-attracted' and likely to benefit from the insect congregations that form at lights. Leisler's bat (Nyctalus leisleri) may be an exception, being more frequent in lit than dark transects. For common pipistrelle bats (Pipistrellus pipistrellus), lighting is negatively associated with their distribution on a landscape scale, but there may be local increases in habitats with good tree cover.

However, despite the recent awareness on the adverse effects of light on bats, little is known regarding the potential impacts of light trapping on the bat sampling outcomes when passive acoustic sampling and light trapping are implemented simultaneously. Using a before-after experimental design that involved the installation of a 6W actinic light trap 1m away from the bat detector, we tested the predictions that (1) slow-flying bat species will be less active when the light trap is present, while the opposite will be true for fast-flying species; and (2) bat species richness will be lower at lit conditions compared to dark ones. Our results suggest that the use of light traps in combination with bat detectors may considerably influence the outcomes of acoustic sampling. Although the activity of fast-flying bat species did not differ between the two treatments, we found that the activity of slow-flying ones such as Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and Rhinolophus hipposideros decreased significantly at lit conditions. Furthermore, we recorded fewer bat species when the light trap was deployed. To overcome this issue, we strongly recommend either (1) placing light traps at a considerable distance from bat detectors; or (2) using light traps during the night that follows the bat sampling if sampling needs to be at the same position; or (3) deploying non-attractant insect traps such as Malaise traps if Lepidoptera is not the main order targeted.","2018-09","03/03/2025 21:00","03/03/2025 21:00",NA,"240-247",NA,"3",4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"Activity; artificial light; bat detector; moth trap; sampling method; species richness",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","Mean number of passes recorded for each species under light and dark treatments.

We acoustically surveyed 31 forest edges across greater Sydney, Australia, half with mercury vapour streetlights and half in ambient darkness, and compared the bat assemblage and activity levels to urban forest interiors. We also sampled the flying insect community to establish whether changes in insect densities under lights drive changes in insectivorous bat activity. We recorded 9965 bat passes from 16 species or species groups throughout our acoustic survey. The activity of all bats, and bats hypothesised to be sensitive to artificial light, was consistently higher in forest interiors as opposed to edges. We found that slower flying bats adapted to cluttered vegetation or with a relatively high characteristic echolocation call frequency; Chalinolobus mono, Miniopterus australis, Vespadelus vulturnus, and Nyctophilus spp., were negatively affected by artificial light sources at the forest edge. The emergence time of Vespadelus vulturnus was also significantly delayed by the presence of streetlights at the forest edge. Conversely, generalist faster flying bats; Chalinolobus gouldii, Ozimops ridei, Austronomous australis, Saccolaimus fiaviventris, and Miniopterus orianae oceanensis, were unaffected by artificial light at the edge of urban forest, and used light and dark forest edges in a similar way.

However, the required needs of humans and wildlife may conflict, resulting in a structure that does not actually provide the perceived improvement in cost-effectiveness, but instead a reduction in conservation benefits. For example, lighting within crossing structures for human safety at night may reduce use of the structure by nocturnal wildlife, thus contributing to barrier and mortality effects of roads rather than mitigating them. In this study, we experimentally evaluated the impact of artificial light at night on the rate of use of wildlife crossing structures, specifically underpasses, by ten insectivorous bat species groups in south-eastern Australia. We monitored bat activity before, during and after artificially lighting the underpasses. We found that bats tended to avoided lit underpasses, and only one species consistently showed attraction to the light. Artificial light at night in underpasses hypothetically increases the vulnerability of bats to road-mortality or to the barrier effect of roads. The most likely outcomes of lighting underpasses were 1. an increase in crossing rate above the freeway and a decrease under the underpasses, or 2. a reduction in crossing rate both above freeways and under the underpasses, when structures were lit.

It interferes with the fundamental 24 h light-dark cycle, and has biological effects at all levels, from molecules to ecosystems, including human health and welfare. Here, exemplified by flood-lit churches, artificial lights compromise the survival of resident bats, as darkness provides protection from predation. We predicted that brown long-eared bats Plecotus auritus emerging from churches should (1) avoid illuminated church walls, and (2) avoid extended flights in the open. To test these predictions, bats were observed emerging from 33 country churches in Sweden. A model for light intensity at increasing distances from light sources was made. This model, in combination with known distance between church walls and surrounding lamps, was used to predict lux levels (lx) at each church wall. Higher light intensities were strictly avoided and the majority of bats emerged when light intensities at church walls were below 1.25 lx. Further, most brown long-eared bats flew into the canopy of trees less than 15 m distant from the churches. Bats and their roosts are strictly protected in Europe, but this is poorly enforced with respect to churches and other historical buildings. Nevertheless, lighting of buildings is a key issue in bat conservation and of worldwide significance.

We used four lighting levels controlled under a central management system at existing street lights in a suburban environment (0,25,50 and 100% of the original output). Higher light intensities (50 and 100% of original output) increased the activity of light-opportunistic species but reduced the activity of light-averse bats.

We measured aerial insectivore responses to light pollution in a tropical cloud forest to test this hypothesis. Bat echolocation was recorded at 20 pairs of light and dark sites in Monteverde, Costa Rica. Foraging activity was higher at artificially lighted sites than dark sites near the new moon, especially around blue-white fluorescent lighting. Most recorded bat species showed increased or unchanged activity in response to light, including some slow-flying and edge-foraging bats. This finding suggests that, contrary to the evaluated hypothesis, flight speed and foraging mode are not sufficient to determine bat responses to artificial lights in the tropics. Two bat species showed decreased activity at light sites, and a low species evenness was recorded around lights, particularly fluorescent lights, compared with dark sites. As in the temperate zone, light pollution in the tropics seems to concentrate certain bat species around human-inhabited areas, potentially shifting community structure.","2019-01","03/03/2025 21:00","03/03/2025 21:00",NA,"Aug-17",NA,"1",35,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA Publisher: CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"Chiroptera; cloud forest; Costa Rica; light pollution",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","Measured foraging activity (number of passes) at light and dark sites.

Bat species did not occur evenly in urban conditions; dark parks were more important for bat diversity and activity ( six species groups in the darkest park) than were artificially lit parkland areas (three species groups in the flood-lit park). Gould's wattled bat (Chalinolobus gouldii) and Mormopterus species 4 (94% of calls) were advantaged in urban parklands, being the only species recorded when lights were on at sports parks, whereas five species groups occurred when the lights were off. Minimal bat activity was recorded in the first 2 h after civil twilight, suggesting that bats may roost outside the city and commute nightly into parklands. Bat activity increased with temperature, with a burst in activity occurring after 7 degrees C. Rainfall (> 1 mm/24h) and moon illumination at midnight did not influence activity.

Anthropogenic light pollution is an increasing global problem [2], affecting ecological interactions across a range of taxa and impacting negatively upon critical animal behaviors including foraging, reproduction, and communication (for review see [2, 3]). Almost all bats are nocturnal [4], making them ideal subjects for testing the effects of light pollution. Previous studies have shown that bat species adapted to foraging in open environments feed on insects attracted to mercury vapor lamps. Here, we use an experimental approach to provide the first evidence of a negative effect of artificial light pollution on the commuting behavior of a threatened bat species. We installed high-pressure sodium lights that mimic the intensity and light spectra of streetlights along commuting routes of lesser horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus hipposideros). Bat activity was reduced dramatically and the onset of commuting behavior was delayed in the presence of lighting, with no evidence of habituation.

Here we compared the potential of two sources of information on light pollution, remote sensing (nocturnal picture taken from the International Space Station ISS) and ground-based (location of streetlights) data, to measure its impact on bats. Our aims were to (i) evaluate how light pollution affected Pipistrellus pipistrellus activity at the city scale, (ii) determine which source of information was the most relevant to measure light pollution's effect and (iii) define a reproducible methodology applicable in land management to account for biodiversity in lighting planning. We used citizen science data to model the activity of P. pipistrellus, a species considered light tolerant, within three cities of France while accounting for artificial light through a variable based on either source of information. We showed that at the city scale, P. pipistrellus activity is negatively impacted by light pollution irrespective of the light variable used. This detrimental effect was better described by variables based on ISS pictures than on streetlights location.

Artificial lights are suspected to have substantial effects on the ecology of many species, e.g., by producing discontinuities in the territories of nocturnal animals. We analyzed the potential influence of the intensity and type of artificial light on bat activity in a semi-natural landscape in France. We used a species approach, followed by a trait-based approach, to light sensitivity. We also investigated whether the effect of light could be related to foraging traits. We performed acoustic surveys at sites located along a gradient of light intensities to assess the activity of 15 species of bats. We identified 2 functional response groups of species: one group that was light-tolerant and one group that was light-intolerant. Among the species in the latter group that appear to be disadvantaged by lighting conditions, many are rare and threatened in Europe, whereas the species from the former group are better able to thrive in disturbed habitats such as lighted areas and may actually benefit from artificial lighting. Finally, several methods of controlling light pollution are suggested for the conservation of bat communities. Recommendations for light management and the creation of dim-light corridors are proposed; these strategies may play an important role in protecting against the impact of light pollution on nocturnal animals.","31/10/2014","03/03/2025 21:00","03/03/2025 21:00",NA,"",NA,"10",9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA Publisher: PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","Measured number of bat calls with differing intensities of light.

Sixty-one of the churches had previously been surveyed by one of us (J.R.) between 1980 and 1990, before lights were installed on Swedish churches, using the same methods. Churches with bat colonies had decreased significantly in frequency from 61% in 1980s to 38% by 2016. All abandoned churches had been fitted with flood-lights in the period between the two surveys. The loss of bat colonies from lit churches was highly significant and most obvious when lights were applied from all directions, leaving no dark corridor for the bats to leave and return to the roost. In contrast, in churches that were not lit, all of 13 bat colonies remained after 25+ years between the surveys.
